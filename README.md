# WUMP_FINAL_PROJECT
This project creates a data collection web application for citizen scientists and professional scientists.
The idea is that citizen scientists ( who are normal people with an interest in science) collect information about their envirmonment by doing experiments. 
They enter the experiments' circumstances and results in a form and this information is then stored in the database. Citizen scientists are allowed only to insert
data into the database, meanwhile professional scientists not only can insert data into the database, but also view all the data and modify it.
The purpose of this project is to help professional scientists collect important information that would not be easily collected otherwise, and also help citizen scientists
learn about scientific data collection.
